This dataset deals with data that led to discovery of handwashing . The dataset shows the number of women giving births and number of deaths in various clinics at Vienna General Hospital between years 1841-1846. Strangely an alraming number of deaths were recorded due to various reasons. When propotion of deaths was figured out it gave a strange figure.

Clinic 1 showed the higher proprtion of deaths. There could have been multiple resons behind this like poor sanitation, inexperinced doctors, bacterial invasion, etc. In order to eradicate this death invasion, washing hands became necessary. When propotion of deaths over time was plotted it reduced highly around 1848. Tis could be the point when people might have started taking handwashing seriously.
