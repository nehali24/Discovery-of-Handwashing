Clinic 1 showed the higher proprtion of deaths. There could have been multiple reasons behind this like poor sanitation, inexperienced doctors, bacterial invasion, etc. In order to eradicate this death invasion, washing hands became necessary. When proportion of deaths over time was plotted it reduced highly around 1848. Tis could be the point when people might have started taking handwashing seriously.

Hand washing became compulsory around 1847, and there was a dip in number of deaths recorded. When handwashing wasn't compulsory the mean proportion of deaths was 0.105 while it started it went down to 0.0210 that is fro 10 % to 2 %. Effect of handwashing on mortality rate could be seen from the figure of statistical analysis.

There is a 95 percent confidence interval between 6.66  to 10.1 . This proves that handwshing was an effective way of reducing deaths.
